**Report on the Digital Commons Policy Landscape**

This report is based on the dataset provided by the NGI Commons, “Mapping the Digital Commons Policy Landscape”. It analyzes 15 policy initiatives concerning open-source software and digital commons at national and regional (supranational) levels. These initiatives span from 2012 to 2024, with a steady but limited introduction of new policies (no more than two per year). Below is a synthesis of the findings, highlighting key aspects to have in mind for understanding today's space in the topic and promoting the articulation with other institutions.

**Geographic and Regional Dynamics**

Of the 15 initiatives, 11 occur in Europe. Seven are regional initiatives, predominantly from the European Union (EU), while four operate nationally in Austria, Germany, and France. The remaining 4 initiatives include one in Argentina and 3 in the United States. As elaborated below, the distinction between regional and national levels is significant for policy implementation and outcomes. This distinction is relevant since generating more capabilities in the national sphere for digital commons is necessary to create partnerships with other entities.

**Policy targets**

Policies typically target three main actors: public institutions, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector. However, the emphasis varies between regional and national levels:

 ***Table 1: Policy targets***
| | Regional level | National level | General |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Civil society organizations | 71% | 75% | 73% |
| Public institutions | 86% | 38% | 60% |
| Private sector | 71% | 63% | 67% |
| N=15. |     |     |     |

Regional policies strongly emphasize public institutions (86%), reflecting their role in coordinating and implementing policies on a broader scale. In contrast, the focus is more evenly distributed nationally, with public institutions targeting less (38%).

**Policy Funding**

Funding mechanisms reveal differences in how regional and national policies support their initiatives:

 ***Table 2: Policy funding***
| | Regional level | National level | General |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- |
| Grants | 100% | 75% | 87% |
| Prizes | 14% | 25% | 20% |
| N=15. |     |     |     |

Regional policies rely almost exclusively on grants, indicating systematic support structures. Prizes are more common nationally, often complementing grants but reflecting a less consistent funding approach.

**Policy goals**

Seven policy goals are identified, with significant variation between regional and national levels:

***Table 3: Policy goals***
| | Regional level | National level | General |
| ---   | --- | --- | --- |
| Sovereignty and security of technologies for governments, organizations, and individuals | 43% | 25% | 33% |
| Innovation and economic opportunities | 57% | 50% | 53% |
| Reduction of costs and mutualization of resources | 43% | 75% | 60% |
| Improved access to immaterial resources and better dissemination of knowledge and culture | 43% | 38% | 40% |
| Competition and better level-playing field | 57% | 25% | 40% |
| Enforcement of digital rights: fundamental freedoms, privacy, consumer rights or labor rights | 43% | 50% | 47% |
| Transparency & accountability, better policymaking | 0%  | 50% | 27% |
| N=15. |     |     |     |

Most of the policies analyzed focus on promoting innovation and economic opportunities regarding the level of implementation (regional or national). Transparency and accountability are prioritized in national policies (50%) but are absent in regional initiatives.

Conversely, competition and technological sovereignty are more significant at the regional level, reflecting the EU’s focus on creating interoperable, secure digital ecosystems. Also, it is interesting that sovereignty and security of technologies for governments, organizations, and individuals have been an issue at the national or regional level from 2015 to 2022.

**Policy Instruments**

Most policies use public funding (100%) and capacity-building measures (67%). Regional initiatives additionally emphasize promotion (86%) and partnerships (43%), whereas regulation and public procurement are nascent instruments, seen only in recent regional policies:

***Table 4: Policy instruments***
| | Regional level | National level | General |
| ---   | --- | --- | --- |
| Regulation | 29% | 0%  | 13% |
| Public funding | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Capacity building, technical and legal assistance | 86% | 50% | 67% |
| Promotion (information and communication dissemination) | 86% | 38% | 60% |
| Partnerships for collaboration with public authorities | 43% | 25% | 33% |
| Public procurement | 29% | 0%  | 13% |
| N=15. |     |     |     |

Key Insight: Regulation is emerging as a critical instrument, with initiatives like the Common European Data Spaces (2022) and Interoperable Europe Act (2024) reflecting this trend.

**Policy Terminology**

Terminology varies significantly between regional and national levels. While Free Open-Source Software/Open-Source Software dominates (87%), regional policies incorporate broader concepts such as:

***Table 5: Policy terminology***
| | Regional level | National level | General |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- |
| Free Open Source Software/ Open Source Software | 71% | 100% | 87% |
| Open norms/ Open standards/ Open protocols | 86% | 13% | 47% |
| Public Digital Infrastructure/ Open infrastructure | 43% | 13% | 27% |
| Open Data | 57% | 38% | 47% |
| Open Access/ Open Science | 14% | 13% | 13% |
| Open Hardware | 29% | 13% | 20% |
| Digital Commons | 29% | 38% | 33% |
| Open Education/ Open Knowledge/ Open Culture | 0%  | 13% | 7%  |
| Other | 14% | 0%  | 7%  |
| N=15. |     |     |     |

Key Insight: The use of Digital Commons as a term has grown since its first appearance in 2019, though its adoption remains limited (33%). Regional policies demonstrate greater conceptual diversity, aligning with the EU's broader policy frameworks promoting interoperability and transparency.

**Conclusion**

The dataset reveals critical dynamics shaping digital commons policies across national and regional levels, emphasizing the need for differentiated policy-making approaches. At the national level, policies predominantly focus on transparency, cost reduction, and targeted grants driven by providing public funding for open-source software. In contrast, regional initiatives exhibit a broader focus, addressing systemic goals such as technological sovereignty, competition, and regulation, with public institutions as their primary targets. A robust articulation strategy tailored to national and regional contexts is essential for fostering effective partnerships. This need poses a great challenge due to the limited emphasis on intergovernmental collaboration; only 33% of the institutions analyzed include partnerships with public authorities as a key instrument. To address this gap:

- At the national level, the focus should be on sharing knowledge derived from the implementation experiences, enabling mutual learning across countries. Employing terminology centered on “free open-source software” can facilitate a shared understanding.
- At the regional level, the articulation should focus on generating the mechanism for economic support and capacity-building. Integrating terminologies such as “digital commons” appears to be an updated strategy emphasizing the generation of infrastructure and regulation.
